This exercise showcases the code for the "delayed" circle exercise for the FMS patient project. The delayed circle exercise has the goal of delaying the color change as one circle is pressed down. For instance, circle one will instantaneously change its color from red to blue; however, this will signal a 2-second delay for the color change for circle two for red to teal. Upon color change of both circles, the exercise is complete.
The code for this exercise is included in the sketch.js file. This file includes the draft exercise where there was a lack of delay, meaning both circles changed color upon the mouse click. This was fixed upon the almost-final code.
To launch this code, open the sketch.js file. Copy all of the code. Open the https://editor.p5js.org/ website. Erase all code from the Editor P5JS website. Paste the code from the sketch.js file, and run the code.
