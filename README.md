# FSE100MASTERPROJECT
This is the final project submission for FSE100 for the FMS Master Project. Kunal Pawar and Sohan Chollera have contributed mainly to this repository, along with Kyle Knowles and Drishti Chandwani. This project was led under the instruction of Rajesh Sathya Kumar.

The final product code is within the folder labeled "FINAL." The file "Sketch.JS" has the entire code for the final Master Project. To launch this code, open the sketch.js file. Copy all of the code. Open the https://editor.p5js.org/ website. Erase all code from the Editor P5JS website. Paste the code from the sketch.js file, and run the code.

There are three exercises in the application. Exercise one and three have similar objectives where the user must loop the shape either in a ring or triangle as many times within a limited timeframe. If the user leaves the ring or triangle, the shape turns red, indicating that they have left the “safe space,” losing points. The user has a goal to remain within the ring or triangle, keeping the shape green to accumulate as many points as possible. Through this repetitive movement, the stroke victim will strengthen their hand-eye coordination and increase their wrist speed as they race against themselves over time to increase their score. The increased hand-eye coordination and wrist speed align with the intended audience of adult stroke victims who have fine motor issues in their hands.

The second exercise differs from the first two stated above. The goal of the second exercise is to have both circles turn blue/teal from red. The user starts off by seeing two red circles; however, the user must hold the first circle down to change its color from red to blue. The user must keep pressing the first circle down and wait until the second circle turns teal. Once both circles change colors, the user accumulates points. Now, the user must complete this within a limited timeframe. This exercise aids the intended audience by strengthening finger skills and aiding in finger dexterity. In holding the button down, there is a combination of hand-eye coordination, wrist strength, and finger strength at play. Thus, all three exercises utilize a combination of hand-eye coordination and finger dexterity to improve fine motor skills for the intended audience.

The progression of this project can be seen throughout the different subfiles within the holistic "P5JS Code with Exercise 1.2.3.GUI.AlmostFinalCODE" file. Each subfile has its individual README within the main branch that details the cooresponding work attached. 

We thank our instructor and graduate teacher assistant for their guidance.

This project was completed at Arizona State University.
