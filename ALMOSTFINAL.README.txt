This portion of the master project was coded in P5JS. This portion showcases the integration of all of the exercises, along with the various GUI components. Numerous changes were created to the original GUI code to make it more eye-catching. For instance, various fonts were added, and the background colors changed between each page. For each exercise, there is a timer component that works. However, this draft of the code showcases the draft implementation of the scoring feature on exercise 2, along with the draft implementation of the title. All other exercises have a functional scoring component.
