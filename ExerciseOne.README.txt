This exercise showcases the game where the FMS patient must loop the circle around the ring. The patient has a goal of keeping the circle within the ring, so that it stays green instead of red. In doing so, the patient accumulates more points. This code showcases the addition of a rudimentary score component; however, it does not include the rudimentary timer component which was added in the final product. Additionally, this code showcases the bug of various values being logged within the console as the program runs (which was fixed in the final product).
